# Creating-a-Shopping-App-Using-Python
I have developed a shopping application or e-commerce application which has login and public login features on the Python platform. The applications that have been developed also include categories, such as 3â€“4 for footwear, clothing, electronics, etc. It is possible to add and update categories in the application. Additionally, it  contains a feature that allows  to add or remove items from the cart. Finally, the program supports a variety of payment options, including UPI and debit cards. (This is only backend implementation, and UX/UI and database connectivity are not done)
